is it possible for layou change for ios

Yes, it's possible to have layout changes for iOS in the white-label system, but it requires additional setup since iOS doesn't have product flavors like Android.

Current iOS Support Status:

The white-label system currently focuses on Android. For iOS, you would need:

Multiple Xcode Schemes - One per school
Multiple Targets or Build Configurations - For different bundle IDs
xcconfig files - For build-time configuration
What's needed for iOS white-label:

Component	Android (Done)	iOS (Needed)
Package/Bundle ID	Product Flavors	Xcode Targets/Schemes
App Name	resValue	Info.plist per target
App Icon	src/{flavor}/res/	Asset catalogs per target
Firebase Config	Build script copies	Build phase script
Environment	react-native-config	react-native-config + xcconfig
Options for iOS:

Xcode Targets - Create separate target per school (most robust)
Build Configurations + xcconfig - Use different configs per school
Build Scripts - Copy files before build (simpler but manual)
Would you like me to implement iOS white-label support with Xcode schemes and build configurations? This would allow you to build different school apps for iOS using commands like:
